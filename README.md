# Studycards 👨‍🎓
AI powered website that allows students to input  study-related content to convert it into interactive flashcards.
## Problem Statement 🧠
An issue I began experiencing when I got into college was that sometimes, it's hard to remember theory just by 
reading it and trying to memorize it. A lot of students (myself included) are visual learners, they need to interact
with the content visually to really remember it. When the material is too large or too technical it can often be difficult
to learn complex concepts or memorize formulas just by reading and highlighting.
## The Idea 💡
So I thought, what if there was a website that could turn your notes into easy-to-understand, concise flashcards that you 
could study with?
What if you could select the class you're trying to study for and get personalized, pocket-sized bits of information that 
you could use to learn hard and complex concepts? That's how Studycards came to life.
## The solution ☑️
Studycards helps students study complex theory and hard exercises in a visual way. Thanks to AI, Studycards can detect 
which class you're studying for and adjust the output to give you precise responses that can enhance the quality of your 
studying. The flashcards can be liked, saved and stored in decks, giving the students the ability to go back to their notes 
to review the content.
